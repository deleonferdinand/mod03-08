				<p>"I love it when you stroke my hair. I feel as if we can understand each other through the contact between your hand and my hair. I love your voice. Just hearing you say one word makes my heart feel warmer. I love your eyes. Normally, they look stern, but when you’re being kind to someone, I love the way they soften. I love your fingers. For a boy, you have such lovely fingers. But when they clutch me, I know they are the strong, slender fingers of a man. I love the way you walk. When we walk together, I love the way you occasionally turn, to make sure I keep up. I love the way you look when you sleep. You look unguarded, like an infant, and your eyelashes are on the long side. When I touch your cheek, you calm down… And when I playfully touch your lips, you don’t even notice… And it makes my heart ache terribly. I love you."</p>
				<p>"No matter what happens, even when it looks like you’re gonna lose, when no one else believes in you, when you don’t believe in your self, I will believe!"</p>
				<p>"When you said that you hate yourself, it made me want to tell you all the wonderful things I know about you.”</p>
				<p>"You stole my sister’s horn and stole my reason to live but that wasn’t enough? Now you have come here, and stole my reason to die, too?"</p>
